/**
 * There are two kinds of Application Commands: global commands and guild commands. Global commands are available for every guild that adds your app; guild commands are specific to the guild you specify when making them. Command names are unique per application within each scope (global and guild). That means:
 *
 * - Your app **cannot** have two global commands with the same name
 * - Your app **cannot** have two guild commands within the same name **on the same guild**
 * - Your app **can** have a global and guild command with the same name
 * - Multiple apps **can** have commands with the same names
 *
 * Global commands are cached for **1 hour**. That means that new global commands will fan out slowly across all guilds, and will be guaranteed to be updated in an hour.
 * Guild commands update **instantly**. We recommend you use guild commands for quick testing, and global commands when they're ready for public use.
